description=[h3]How it works[/h3]
description=[i]Original description:
description=Unmodded Project Zomboid gives the player Sprinting XP based on a random number generator, which provides slow trickles of unreliable XP.
description=This mod creates a new method of XP gain, in which sprinting fills up an invisible bar, which once full will grant the player Sprinting XP and then empty itself.
description=The time to fill the bar and the XP provided are alterable using ModOptions.

description=Adds additional XP gains to sprinting.
description=Default XP gains to sprinting are untouched, this only adds the standardized xp gain on top of vanilla xp to ensure compatibility with mods.
description=Default settings are 10 xp per ~15.65 seconds.[/i]
