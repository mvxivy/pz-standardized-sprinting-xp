description=Unmodded Project Zomboid gives the player Sprinting XP based on a random number generator, which provides slow trickles of unreliable XP.
description=This mod creates a new method of XP gain, in which sprinting fills up an invisible bar, which once full will grant the player Sprinting XP and then empty itself.
description=The time to fill the bar and the XP provided are alterable using mod settings.
